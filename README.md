# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification
Classification of various hand written digits using Multi layer Neural Network

MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is classified using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. The main purpose of this project is
to find out how this neural network behave in different settings. These settings include:-

1) Different number of Hidden Nodes:- We saw how the accuracy of the neural network changes with the number of hidden nodes in 
the system. And from the data we observed that the accuracy of the neural network increases with the number of hidden nodes. We 
observed that the accuracy improves drastically when increment is done on small number of nodes but after certain number of 
nodes, accuracy increases only in small amounts.

2) Regularization Factor:- This factor is used to control the over fitting of the training data. The regularization factor is 
increamented at a constant rate of 0.1 from 0 to 1. Observation showed that increasing this factor's value flutuates the accuracies
for different data set but the most optimum solution is found at regularization factor value of 1.
